### Lab: Host a Static Website on Amazon S3
Objective
By the end of this lab, you will:
Create and configure an S3 bucket for static website hosting.


Upload HTML and other website assets.


Make your site publicly accessible using Bucket Policies.


Test your site via the S3 website endpoint.


(Optional) Configure a custom domain using Amazon Route 53.



Prerequisites
An AWS account (Free Tier eligible).


 IAM user with AmazonS3FullAccess.


AWS CLI configured (aws configure).


A simple website folder on your local system:

 website/
├── index.html
└── error.html
Example content for testing:
 index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Welcome to My S3 Website</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from S3!</h1>
    <p>This website is hosted entirely on Amazon S3.</p>
  </body>
</html>

error.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Page Not Found</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
    <p>Sorry, the page you requested does not exist.</p>
  </body>
</html>

Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
Using AWS Console:
Go to the Amazon S3 Console.


Click “Create bucket”.


Enter a unique bucket name:

 my-static-website-damian
 ⚠️ Bucket names must be globally unique and DNS-compliant.


Choose your AWS region (e.g., us-east-1).


Uncheck “Block all public access” since websites need to be publicly accessible.


Confirm the warning and proceed.


Click Create bucket.



Step 2: Upload Website Files
Click your newly created bucket.


Select Upload → Add files.


Upload both:


index.html


error.html


Click Upload.


Your files will now appear in the bucket.

Step 3: Configure Static Website Hosting
Go to the Properties tab of the bucket.


Scroll down to Static website hosting.


Click Edit → Enable.


Choose Host a static website.


Enter:


Index document: index.html


Error document: error.html


Save changes.


✅ Once enabled, you’ll see a Website endpoint link like:
http://my-static-website-damian.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

Keep this URL — you’ll use it shortly.

Step 4: Make Website Files Public
By default, S3 objects are private. Let’s fix that.
Go to the Permissions tab → Bucket policy.


Click Edit and paste this policy (replace the bucket name):


{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-static-website-damian/*"
    }
  ]
}

Save changes.


Now your site is publicly accessible via the website endpoint.

Step 5: Test Your Website
Open the Website endpoint in your browser.


You should see:

 Hello from S3!
This website is hosted entirely on Amazon S3.
To test the error page:

 http://my-static-website-damian.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/unknown.html
 You should see the custom 404 page.


Step 7: (Optional) Custom Domain + Route 53
If you have a domain (e.g., mywebsite.com):
Create another S3 bucket named exactly your domain name (mywebsite.com).


Upload the same website files.


Enable static hosting.


In Route 53, create an Alias A record:


Name: mywebsite.com


Value: the S3 website endpoint.


For HTTPS (since S3 endpoints are HTTP-only):


Use CloudFront as a CDN with SSL enabled via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).



Step 8: Cleanup



Key Takeaways
S3 supports static website hosting, not dynamic applications.


Each bucket is a unique global namespace.


Use bucket policies, not ACLs, for public access control.


You can integrate with Route 53 + CloudFront for a professional domain and HTTPS.


S3 + CloudFront is a powerful, low-cost solution for static sites and documentation hosting.
