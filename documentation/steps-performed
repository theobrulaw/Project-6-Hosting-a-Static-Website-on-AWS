Lab: Host a Static Website on Amazon S3 (Dr. Igbe Cloud Technology Experts)

Objective
By the end of this lab, you will:
-Create and configure an S3 bucket for static website hosting.
-Upload HTML and other website assets.
-Make your site publicly accessible using Bucket Policies.
-Test your site via the S3 website endpoint.
-(Optional) Configure a custom domain using Amazon Route 53.

Prerequisites
1. An AWS account (Free Tier eligible).
2. IAM user with AmazonS3FullAccess.
3. AWS CLI configured (aws configure).

A simple website folder on your local system:

 website/
├── index.html
└── error.html
Example content for testing:
 index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Welcome to My S3 Website</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from S3!</h1>
    <p>This website is hosted entirely on Amazon S3.</p>
  </body>
</html>

error.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Page Not Found</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
    <p>Sorry, the page you requested does not exist.</p>
  </body>
</html>

Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
1. Using AWS Console:
2. Go to the Amazon S3 Console.

Click “Create bucket”.

Enter a unique bucket name:
my-static-website-damian
3. ⚠️ Bucket names must be globally unique and DNS-compliant.
4. Choose your AWS region (e.g., us-east-1).
5. Uncheck “Block all public access” since websites need to be publicly accessible.
6. Confirm the warning and proceed.
7. Click Create bucket.

Step 2: Upload Website Files
1. Click your newly created bucket.
2. Select Upload → Add files.
3. Upload both:
   index.html
   error.html
4. Click Upload.

Your files will now appear in the bucket.

Step 3: Configure Static Website Hosting
1. Go to the Properties tab of the bucket.
2. Scroll down to Static website hosting.
3. Click Edit → Enable.
4. Choose Host a static website.
5. Enter:
   Index document: index.html
   Error document: error.html
6. Save changes.

✅ Once enabled, you’ll see a Website endpoint link like:
http://my-static-website-damian.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

Keep this URL — you’ll use it shortly.

Step 4: Make Website Files Public
By default, S3 objects are private. Let’s fix that.
1. Go to the Permissions tab → Bucket policy.
2. Click Edit and paste this policy (replace the bucket name):

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-static-website-damian/*"
    }
  ]
}

3. Save changes.

Now your site is publicly accessible via the website endpoint.

Step 5: Test Your Website
Open the Website endpoint in your browser.

You should see:

 Hello from S3!
This website is hosted entirely on Amazon S3.
To test the error page:

 http://my-static-website-damian.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/unknown.html
 You should see the custom 404 page.


Step 7: (Optional) Custom Domain + Route 53
If you have a domain (e.g., mywebsite.com):
1. Create another S3 bucket named exactly your domain name (mywebsite.com).
2. Upload the same website files.
3. Enable static hosting.
4. In Route 53, create an Alias A record:
   Name: mywebsite.com
   Value: the S3 website endpoint.
5.For HTTPS (since S3 endpoints are HTTP-only):
   Use CloudFront as a CDN with SSL enabled via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

Step 8: Cleanup

Key Takeaways
-S3 supports static website hosting, not dynamic applications.
-Each bucket is a unique global namespace.
-Use bucket policies, not ACLs, for public access control.
-You can integrate with Route 53 + CloudFront for a professional domain and HTTPS.
-S3 + CloudFront is a powerful, low-cost solution for static sites and documentation hosting.
